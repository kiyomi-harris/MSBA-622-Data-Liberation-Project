# Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services Data Analysis

This repository contains data obtained by the [Data Liberation Project](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/), via a [Freedom of Information Act request](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/datasets/aphis-inspection-reports/) to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and pre-processed by the Data Liberation Project. 

## Summary of Findings

What did we find? Well let me tell you! With **images**! 

Here are some screenshots showcasing the analysis:

## Background and Motivation

The APHIS Inspection Reports dataset enhances transparency and accountability in animal welfare. While the USDA publishes inspection data, it lacks full accessibility and key details. The Data Liberation Project fills this gap by compiling and updating the data in an easy-to-use format.


## Code

This repository contains one Malloy code file:

- [`APHIS_LiberationProject_revised.malloynb`](APHIS_LiberationProject_revised.malloynb), performs the analysis piece of the data provided by the Data Liberation Project.

## Why Malloy?
[Malloy](https://malloydata.dev) is an open source semantic data language, and a compelling alternative to pandas, ggplot, and SQL!
